When the debugger encounters a breakpoint during runtime, it stops the program's execution at that specific line of code, allowing you to inspect the program's state, variable values, and perform interactive debugging actions. This feature is incredibly useful for identifying and resolving issues in your code step by step. To set a breakpoint, you usually add a special marker or call a debugger function at the desired location in your code."
